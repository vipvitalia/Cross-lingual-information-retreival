# Cross-lingual-information-retreival

Recommending books for users who speak more languages than one, faces several challenges such that, for example, a certain book might not be translated in some languages, or might be freely available in only one language, etc. For example, a journalist or investigator, governmental institution, market analyst might want to find documents similar to a given one but in different language or companies that are constantly watching what people are writing about them or about their new product. Widespread information retrieval systems are generally monolingual and therefore incapable of satisfying these users information needs.Recommending books for users who speak more languages than one, faces several challenges such that, for example, a certain book might not be translated in some languages, or might be freely available in only one language, etc. For example, a journalist or investigator, governmental institution, market analyst might want to find documents similar to a given one but in different language or companies that are constantly watching what people are writing about them or about their new product.
